## About

I keep this repo for recording and tracking my study on the fundamental data structure and algorithms.
Usually I spend hours in the weekends on this topic and this repo.

One friend of mine ever asked me: Does solving these programming puzzles help you at work? 
My answer is: No and Yes.

- No: At work, I built larger scale software systems in which the particular basic algorithms used in these puzzles are not the crutial part. In real world projects, to me the more important parts are the architecture, how could you provide a good interface, how do you leverage the existing libraries or open source projects, how do you customize the system to best meet your customer's needs, etc. On these levels, the techniques used in solving programming puzzles couldn't help much.

- Yes: To me one of the benefits of learning how to solve the programming puzzles is that you learn to master the most common algorithms which could be used to solve a wide range of problems. For those who work on Software Development but did not major in Computer Science when they were in college, perhaps learning these puzzles are even more valuable. It is a great training process through which you understand the algorithms not only in theory, but also in practice. Personally I feel that when I understand the fundamental stuff better and deeper, I tend to come up with better solutions when facing the problem in real projects.

So in summary, I would say that you don't necessarily need solve the coding puzzles to get your work done when you build a software system, but you probably could do your work better if you understand well about these basic coding puzzles.
